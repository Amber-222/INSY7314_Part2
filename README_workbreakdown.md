# THIS README WILL CHANGE BEFORE SUBMISSION

okay so team breakdown on who's doing what

# BACKEND
## Jess
### Registration Logic
when users open the website's register page, met with a form to fill out (details needed are in word doc)

## Amber
### Payment Page Logic
after log in, users have to fill out details about payment they're making to log in db (details in word doc)

### Employee Dashboard Logic
view all pending payments, verify as employee clicks and send off to swift to process 

## Stefan
### Login Logic 
form for account details, look for their account match in db, redirect as necessary

### Confirmation 'pop-up' Logic
there's a way to replicate modal pop ups from mvc in react (same as our c# tutorial pop ups) to fill out final details to log payment as needing verification

# FRONTEND
## Everyone
when building your logic (methods), create basic screens for testing purposes and correct routing in code

## Jess
as the logic for different sections is completed, make the screens more professional and appropriate
